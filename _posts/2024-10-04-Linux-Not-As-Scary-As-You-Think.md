<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>inux! Did I scare you? For many, the idea of using, much less installing, any linux distribution sounds both daunting and potentially dangerous. This guide will hopefully ease you in and help you along so you too can enjoy the lack of bloatware that is Ubuntu. </p>

### Why Linux?

Now, you may be thinking, "Why would I even want to install Linux?" There are many reasons. Here are a few:

1. Microsoft is killing Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. Now this does not mean your computer will suddenly stop working, but it does mean it will be vulnerable to potential malware. For many, we would love to upgrade to Windows 11, but our computers simply do not have the ability to run it.

2. Ubuntu (and most Linux distros) are much less bloated than Windows, and even some Apple products. 

3. Most Linux distros are free and open source!

4. It feels very similar to, and even can be customized to act just like, Windows and MacOS.

5. It is sad to let a good computer go to waste, so give new life to an old computer with a safe, secure, and simple operating system

For those who are afraid of potentially messing up your computer, no need to worry. Linux is safe, and relatively easy to install. And, although you can lose data if you don't back things up (like with any system), you are unlikely to break your computer by replacing the operating system. 
*That being said, I must clarify this now: I am not responsible for any problems, issues, damage, stress, or other negativity that may occur during this process. I am providing my best understanding to help provide both options and joy in Linux*

I usually feel more prepared when an outline is provided, so here are the major steps in the installation process we will cover:

1. Getting Ready
2. Booting Up Into Ubuntu
3. Installation Options
4. Personalization
5. Install!
6. Troubleshooting

As trouble can depend on your specific computer, feel free to skip to troubleshooting if anything goes wrong. Now, lets get started!
